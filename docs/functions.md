## Operation details
This section provides details on each of the operations.

### Granting permission to use a function to an AWS service or another account
The addPermission implementation of the POST operation grants an AWS service or another account permission to use a function.You can apply the policy at the function level, or specify a qualifier to restrict access to a single version or alias. If you use a qualifier, the invoker must use the full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of that version or alias to invoke the function. To grant permission to another account, specify the account ID as the Principal. For AWS services, the principal is a domain-style identifier defined by the service, like s3.amazonaws.com or sns.amazonaws.com. For AWS services, you can also specify the ARN or owning account of the associated resource as the SourceArn or SourceAccount. If you grant permission to a service principal without specifying the source, other accounts could potentially configure resources in their account to invoke your Lambda function. This action adds a statement to a resource-based permission policy for the function. For more information about function policies, see [Lambda Function Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html).

**addPermission**
```xml
<amazonlambda.addPermission>
    <functionName>{$ctx:functionName}</functionName>
    <action>{$ctx:action}</action>
    <statementId>{$ctx:statementId}</statementId>
    <principal>{$ctx:principal}</principal>
</amazonlambda.addPermission>
```

**Properties**
* functionName: Name of the Lambda function, version, or alias.
* action: The action that the principal can use on the function.For example, lambda:InvokeFunction or lambda:GetFunction.
* statementId: A statement identifier that differentiates the statement from others in the same policy.
* principal: The AWS service or account that invokes the function. If you specify a service, use SourceArn or SourceAccount to limit who can invoke the function through that service.

**Sample request**

Following is a sample REST request that can be handled by the addPermission operation.

## Creating a Lambda function
The createFunction operation creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a [ deployment package ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/deployment-package-v2.html) and an [ execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-permissions.html#lambda-intro-execution-role). The deployment package contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and AWS X-Ray for request tracing. A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration. A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed to map to a different version. Use the Publish parameter to create version 1 of your function from its initial configuration. The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify version-specific settings later with [ UpdateFunctionConfiguration ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_UpdateFunctionConfiguration.html). Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the function, and include tags ([TagResource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_TagResource.html)) and per-function concurrency limits ([PutFunctionConcurrency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_PutFunctionConcurrency.html)). If another account or an AWS service invokes your function, use [AddPermission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_AddPermission.html) to grant permission by creating a resource-based IAM policy. You can grant permissions at the function level, on a version, or on an alias. To invoke your function directly, use [Invoke](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_Invoke.html). To invoke your function in response to events in other AWS services, create an event source mapping ([CreateEventSourceMapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_CreateEventSourceMapping.html)), or configure a function trigger in the other service. For more information, see [Invoking Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invoking-lambda-functions.html).

## Deleting a Lambda function
Implementation of deleteFunction method deletes a Lambda function. To delete a specific function version, use the Qualifier parameter. Otherwise, all versions and aliases are deleted. To delete Lambda event source mappings that invoke a function, use [DeleteEventSourceMapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_DeleteEventSourceMapping.html). For AWS services and resources that invoke your function directly, delete the trigger in the service where you originally configured it.

**deleteFunction**
```xml
<amazonlambda.deleteFunction>
    <functionName>{$ctx:functionName}</functionName>
    <qualifier>{$ctx:qualifier}</qualifier>
</amazonlambda.deleteFunction>

## Getting the version specific settings of a Lambda function or version
Implementation of getFunctionConfiguration operation returns the version-specific settings of a Lambda function or version. The output includes only option that can vary between versions of a function. To modify these settings, use [UpdateFunctionConfiguration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_UpdateFunctionConfiguration.html). To get all of a function's details, including function-level settings, use [GetFunction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetFunction.html).

**getFunctionConfiguration**
```xml
<amazonlambda.getFunctionConfiguration>
    <functionName>{$ctx:functionName}</functionName>
    <qualifier>{$ctx:qualifier}</qualifier>
</amazonlambda.getFunctionConfiguration>
```

**Properties**
* functionName: The name of the Lambda function.
* qualifier: Specify a version to delete. You can't delete a version that's referenced by an alias.

**Sample request**

## Invoking a Lambda function
Implementation of invoke operation invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and wait for the response), or asynchronously. To invoke a function asynchronously, set InvocationType to Event. For synchronous invocation, details about the function response, including errors, are included in the response body and headers. For either invocation type, you can find more information in the [execution log](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions.html) and trace. To record function errors for asynchronous invocations, configure your function with a [dead letter queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/dlq.html). The status code in the API response doesn't reflect function errors. Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your function from executing, such as permissions errors, [limit errors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/limits.html), or issues with your function's code and configuration. For example, Lambda returns TooManyRequestsException if executing the function would cause you to exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level (ConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded) or function level (ReservedFunctionConcurrentInvocationLimitExceeded). For functions with a long timeout, your client might be disconnected during synchronous invocation while it waits for a response. Configure your HTTP client, SDK, firewall, proxy, or operating system to allow for long connections with timeout or keep-alive settings. This operation requires permission for the lambda:InvokeFunction action.

**invoke**
```xml
<amazonlambda.invoke>
    <functionName>{$ctx:functionName}</functionName>
    <qualifier>{$ctx:qualifier}</qualifier>
    <x-amz-invocation-type>{$ctx:x-amz-invocation-type}</x-amz-invocation-type>
    <x-amz-log-type>{$ctx:x-amz-log-type}</x-amz-log-type>
    <x-amz-client-context>{$ctx:x-amz-client-context}</x-amz-client-context>
    <requestPayload>{$ctx:requestPayload}</requestPayload>
</amazonlambda.invoke>
```

**Properties**
* functionName: The name of the Lambda function.
* qualifier: Specify a version to delete. You can't delete a version that's referenced by an alias.
* x-amz-invocation-type: It specifies the way you want to invoke the function.
        
    Choose from the following options.
        
        i)    RequestResponse (default) - Invoke the function synchronously. Keep the connection open until the function returns a response or times out. The API response includes the function response and additional data.
        
        ii)   Event - Invoke the function asynchronously. Send events that fail multiple times to the function's dead-letter queue (if it's configured). The API response only includes a status code.
        
        iii)  DryRun - Validate parameter values and verify that the user or role has permission to invoke the function.
        
* x-amz-log-type: It specifies whether to include the execution log in the response. Set to Tail to include it in the response. Valid values are: None and Tail
* x-amz-client-context: It's the base64-encoded data about the invoking client to pass to the function in the context object. It can be up to 3583 bytes. 
* requestPayload: The JSON that you want to provide to your Lambda function as input.

**Sample request**

Following is a sample REST request that can be handled by the invoke operation.
```json

## Returning a list of functions
The listMethod implementation returns a list of Lambda functions, with the version-specific configuration of each. Set FunctionVersion to ALL to include all published versions of each function in addition to the unpublished version. To get more information about a function or version, use [GetFunction](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetFunction.html).

**listFunctions**
```xml
<amazonlambda.listFunctions>
    <functionVersion>{$ctx:functionVersion}</functionVersion>
    <marker>{$ctx:marker}</marker>
    <masterRegion>{$ctx:masterRegion}</masterRegion>
    <maxItems>{$ctx:maxItems}</maxItems>
</amazonlambda.listFunctions>
```

**Properties**
* functionVersion: Version name which specifies the version to include in entries for each function. Set to ALL to include entries for all published versions of each function.
* marker: It specifies the pagination token that is returned by a previous request to retrieve the next page of results.
* masterRegion: For Lambda@Edge functions, the AWS Region of the master function. For example, us-east-2 or ALL. If specified, you must set FunctionVersion to ALL..
* maxItems: It specifies the value, ranging from 1 to 10000, to limit the number of functions in the response. 

**Sample request**

Following is a sample REST request that can be handled by the listFunctions operation.

## Revoking permission to use function from an AWS service or another account
The removePermission implementation of the DELETE method revokes function-use permission from an AWS service or another account. You can get the ID of the statement from the output of [GetPolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_GetPolicy.html).

**removePermission**
```xml
<amazonlambda.removePermission>
    <functionName>{$ctx:functionName}</functionName>
    <statementId>{$ctx:statementId}</statementId>

    <revisionId>{$ctx:revisionId}</revisionId>
</amazonlambda.removePermission>
```

**Properties**
* functionName: Name of the Lambda function.
* statementId: Statement ID of the permission to remove.
* qualifier: It specifies a version or alias to remove permission from a published version of the function.
* revisionId: It's a Id which allow to update the policy only if the revision ID matches the ID that's specified. Use this option to avoid modifying a policy that has changed since you last read it.
